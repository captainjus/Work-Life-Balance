# Work Life Balance

Work-life balance is a 3d healthcare awareness serious game that is targeted for individuals that have experienced hospital admission. Players will play as a patient recently discharged from the hospital and have to perform specific actions under restrictions to achieve one goal: to prevent hospital readmission. Each action will increase/decrease the physical, mental, nutrition, wakefulness, hygiene, and energy, depending on the action.
