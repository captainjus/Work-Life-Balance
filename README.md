# Work Life Balance

Work-life balance is a 3d healthcare awareness serious game that is targeted for individuals that have experienced hospital admission. Players will play as a patient recently discharged from the hospital and have to perform specific actions under restrictions to achieve one goal: to prevent hospital readmission. Each action will increase/decrease the physical, mental, nutrition, wakefulness, hygiene, and energy, depending on the action.

## How to play:
- Move with WASD keys
- Move the camera using the mouse

## Important notes for current build
- The bed can only be slept on when it is night time, system will tell you when it is nighttime. To do so, just collide with the bed
- When selecting an action, if there is not enough time in the day to do the action, the game will not let you do the action. Please note that a window to display the message that player does not have enough time is not yet implemented.
- Please collide with the other gray cube in the scene for actions
