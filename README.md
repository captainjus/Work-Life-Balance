# Work Life Balance

Work-life balance is a 3d healthcare awareness serious game that is targeted for individuals that have experienced hospital admission. Players will play as a patient recently discharged from the hospital and have to perform specific actions under restrictions to achieve one goal: to prevent hospital readmission. Each action will increase/decrease the physical, mental, nutrition, wakefulness, hygiene, and energy, depending on the action.

Level and Character Design: 
The reason we are choosing to have the realistic level design and character design is
because our serious game is set in the world as a simulator of someone who has some
sort of illness that needs to take care of themself. 

As we are trying to make this as analogous to real life as we can, it is
important that we have designs that the player will not realize are abstract. The
player model will not have a jetpack on or a hospital won't be just 1 floor are some
examples that will make the player think twice about what kind of world this is set
in.
