# Work Life Balance

Work-life balance is a 3d healthcare awareness serious game that is targeted for individuals that have experienced hospital admission. Players will play as a patient recently discharged from the hospital and have to perform specific actions under restrictions to achieve one goal: to prevent hospital readmission. Each action will increase/decrease the physical, mental, nutrition, wakefulness, hygiene, and energy, depending on the action.

Level and Character Design: 
The reason we are choosing to have the realistic level design and character design is
because our serious game is set in the world as a simulator of someone who has some
sort of illness that needs to take care of themself. 

As we are trying to make this as analogous to real life as we can, it is important that we have designs that the player will not realize are abstract. The player model will not have a jetpack on or a hospital won't be just 1 floor are some examples that will make the player think twice about what kind of world this is set in.

## How to play:
- Move with WASD keys
- Move the camera using the mouse
- Zoom in minimap with 'numpad +'
- Zoom out minimap with 'numpad -'
- Open/close map with 'm'
- Open task list by holding tab


## Important notes for current build
- The bed can only be slept on when it is night time, system will tell you when it is nighttime. To do so, just collide with the bed
- When selecting an action, if there is not enough time in the day to do the action, the game will not let you do the action. Please note that a window to display the message that player does not have enough time is not yet implemented.
- Important buildings are on the map seen through minimap or map
